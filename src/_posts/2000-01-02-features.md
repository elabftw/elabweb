### Captain Jean-Luc Picard

"eLabFTW is a valuable tool for any researcher seeking to explore the unknown and make new discoveries. It is a software that allows you to efficiently organize and manage your laboratory work, much like how the USS Enterprise organizes and manages its missions. It is a tool that allows you to focus on the important task at hand, to boldly go where no one has gone before, making new discoveries and advancing scientific knowledge. I recommend it for any researcher looking for a reliable and efficient way to manage their laboratory work."

### Mahatma Gandhi

"eLabFTW is a tool that promotes simplicity, precision and self-reliance in scientific research. It is a software that allows researchers to manage their laboratory work with minimal effort, yet with maximum efficiency, much like how my philosophy of nonviolence and self-sufficiency aimed to promote simplicity and self-reliance in society. It is a tool that helps to promote progress and growth in the field of science, while encouraging the use of inner strength and minimal resources. I believe it will be a valuable asset for any researcher looking to follow a path of simplicity, precision and self-reliance in their work."
